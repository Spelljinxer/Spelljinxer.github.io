                The head shrine maiden in charge of Grand Narukami Shrine and a
                descendant of Kitsune lineage, Eternity's servant and friend,
                and the intimidating editor-in-chief of Yae Publishing House, 
                a publisher of light novels.
                <br><br>
                There's no need to uncover her every facet, as they are all reflective of Yae Miko. 
                Yet, all the same, they are not revealing of her true nature.
                Like fragments of a mirror, each attitude reflects a different version of her. 
                By being enveloped in many identities, she has become a brilliant diamond surrounded by countless mirrors.
                <br><br>
                There are hundreds of facets: solemn or cheerful, sympathetic or aloof.
                But if the kitsune watches humans, <em>where will her destiny lead?</em>

                  Miko has a mysterious demeanor around her whenever she assumes her duties as the Guuji of the Grand Narukami Shrine. 
                  As a kitsune and youkai, she's very mischievous, including in her roles as Guuji and owner of Yae Publishing House.
                  <br><br>
                  She couples this mischievous streak with impressive skills of manipulation and reading people. 
                  As such her tricks and pranks are usually elaborate, long-winded affairs towards rather simple ends, 
                  which she does out of enjoyment and the fact that she enjoys watching people squirm
                  <br><br>
                  She is one of Ei's only friends who survived the ravages of time. 
                  She tends to call the Shogun by her true name, Ei. 
                  Ei herself also calls Miko by her first name, signifying their closeness and friendship.
